# Triangle angle calculator

This module can calculate triangles angles and side length from any given information (of course you need a minimum number of known parameters).

In your CLI execute:

`python tranglerectangle.py AB BC AC CAB ABC BCA`

Where you replace the value by the length or the angles if you have them, or 0 if you dont have them. It also works if angles are > 90Â°.
